				"content_text": "It's Autumn and it's a Friday.\n\nIn Melbourne that can mean a dreary end to the week, but sometimes it's a surprise; cool but sunny.\n\nBeing a Friday, grandchild #1.4 is over for the day. She's two, so if I suggest a walk she's up for it, because _everything_ is an adventure when you're two.  We head out the door and we're dazzled by sunshine and blue sky.  \n\n<aside>\n\nI really have to grasp at these moments; they're lost if you look away for a second.\n\nAn unexpected sunny day, a bright-eyed toddler who wants my company and me having time to offer it. That won't always be a thing. I've been a grandparent for ten years already and it feels like the older kids are already setting off on their own lives.  \n\nFor the moment, this little one is totally absorbed in our outing and I need to make sure I am too.\n\n</aside>\n<br/>\n{{< simple-image src=\"/uploads/2023/8bdab359ac.jpg\" >}}\n\n\n\n  \n\nShe grabs my hand and it completely encloses hers as we head up the driveway.  What is it about holding a toddler's tiny, soft hand that way?\n\n\n\n<aside>I've struggled to just chill and go with the flow and enjoy the grandkids company. It’s taken a long time to silence that nagging thing at the back of my head telling me to wind this up and get back to something else.\n\nI seem to be getting past it. For the past couple of years I've been able to slow down and smell the roses.\n\nWell... the Callistemons in this case...\n</aside>\n\n{{< simple-image src=\"/uploads/2023/d6a789e7fc.jpg\" >}}\n\n\nWe spend five minutes discussing the bee and what it's up to. She only has a few words, but that's not a problem; she can have an animated conversation with just \"_mmm_\"s , \"_nope_\"s and \"_uhoh_\"s. \n\nIt seems like only weeks ago she was a mute pre-toddler who only communicated with grins and grizzles. Now there's a confident little person in there who just assumes I understand everything she says.\n\n<br/>\n\n<video width=\"\" height=\"\" controls>\n  <source src=\"/uploads/2023/media.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n</video> \n\n\nNext is the obligatory shuffle through the Autumn leaves.

I nuke the dandelion and she's delighted by my super powers. \n\n<aside>It's nice that I'm a wizard for a little while who can do hilarious and magical things. It's a very small window.
